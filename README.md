## üåü Features

The Astronomists delivers an immersive interface designed to highlight both the scientific rigor of the ML pipeline and the accessibility of a modern user experience.

### üè† Home Page
An immersive interface with a futuristic space-inspired design and starfield animation. This opening screen places the user directly "in space," setting the tone for exploration and discovery.

### üõ∏ Exploration Path
The central hub for selecting AI agents to investigate exoplanets. It offers three paths of analysis:

1. **Johannes Kepler** - for confirmed exoplanets
2. **Grace Hopper** - for advanced analysis of new candidates  
3. **Mission Dashboard** - for monitoring NASA missions on exoplanets

## üî≠ Exploration Paths

### 1st Path - New Exoplanets Data

#### Grace Hopper Agent - Data Page
An interactive analysis interface for candidate exoplanets. Users can manually enter orbital and stellar parameters, run ML-powered predictions, or dive deeper with integrated Jupyter notebooks preloaded for training and data exploration.

**Two modes of input:**
- **Tabular data input** ‚Äì Users provide orbital and stellar parameters manually (or load an example dataset). The data is sent to a backend ML model exposed through an API, returning predictions (possible candidate, candidate, or false positive).
- **Transit data input** ‚Äì Users upload light-curve data for analysis by AstronetCNN, a deep learning model trained on KOI data. The system automatically returns classification results.

The page includes an integrated notebook viewer, allowing users to load the model's predictions, inspect the workflow, and run custom analyses within an interactive environment.

#### Grace Hopper Agent Report
The Grace Hopper agent receives raw input (tabular or transit data) and synthesizes this information with its knowledge and the ML model's predictions to provide an informed, contextualized opinion on whether the signal represents an exoplanet.

### 2nd Path - Analyzing Existing Exoplanets Data

#### Kepler Input
A dedicated search interface for confirmed exoplanets, providing quick access to famous planets such as Kepler-22b, TRAPPIST-1e, and Gliese 581g. Features an intelligent search engine alongside shortcut buttons for well-known discoveries.

#### Kepler Planet Results
An exoplanet analysis dashboard that combines NASA Eyes visualizations with detailed scientific data. The screen is split: an interactive 3D visualization on the left, and an orbital and stellar characteristics panel on the right, with navigation links toward system-level analysis.

#### Kepler System Viewer
A stellar system viewer designed with dual NASA Eyes for both a global system view and a focused star-centric perspective. The immersive interface lets users examine the complete system while zooming into stellar magnifications, with action buttons to connect directly to the Kepler agent and the bibliographic search module.

#### Kepler Bibliographic Research
A bibliographic AI agent dedicated to analyzing the scientific literature through databases such as arXiv and peer-reviewed astronomical publications. This specialized interface searches for methodologies, highlights recent discoveries, and generates intelligent syntheses of knowledge related to the specific exoplanet and its solar system.

#### Kepler Agent Report
The intelligence center for the Johannes Kepler AI agent, delivering an automated scientific report and an interactive chat. This sophisticated interface generates detailed analyses powered by AI, integrates NASA Eyes data, and supports real-time dialogue for in-depth scientific exploration.

### 3rd Path - Discovering NASA's Exoplanets Missions

#### Mission Dashboard
A mission control center for NASA's space observatories, featuring a complete catalog of both active and retired missions. The dashboard showcases missions such as TESS, JWST, Kepler, Spitzer, and Hubble, with detailed cards describing their orbits, instruments, and key discoveries.

#### Mission Viewer
An integrated NASA Eyes immersive viewer for real-time exploration of NASA missions. This full-screen interface displays spacecraft and telescopes in action, offering interactive controls, mission data overlays, and smooth navigation for a complete tour of the instruments shaping our view of the universe.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The Astronomist is a full-stack web application developed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge, addressing the task of automatic exoplanet identification using artificial intelligence and machine learning.

### Backend
Built with **FastAPI**, a modern Python web framework enabling efficient integration with specialized AI agents. The backend handles user requests, authentication, and the core exoplanet data analysis pipeline, orchestrated through two agents: Johannes Kepler and Grace Hopper.

### Frontend
Developed as a responsive web application using **Next.js 15**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The interface features a futuristic spatial theme with hyperspace starfield animations and interactive 3D exoplanet visualizations, directly using NASA Eyes embedded on the pages.

### Data Integration
Connected to the **NASA Exoplanet Archive** via astroquery to retrieve and process satellite datasets from the Kepler, K2, and TESS missions. The system also integrates **arXiv** for scientific literature and **Perplexity AI** for intelligent synthesis of web-based knowledge.

### Machine Learning Models
- **HistGradientBoostingClassifier** with an advanced preprocessing pipeline, trained on NASA's open datasets. The model achieves an F1 score of **83.1%** in three-class classification (confirmed exoplanets, planetary candidates, false positives), validated through cross-mission testing.
- **AstronetCNN** deep learning algorithm trained on KOI data, used to classify light curves, achieving an F1-score of **65%**.

### Specialized AI Agents
Two distinct agents powered by the **OpenAI Agents framework**:
- **Johannes Kepler** - for in-depth analysis of NASA data and bibliographic research
- **Grace Hopper** - for advanced exploration combining literature review, web intelligence, and support for JWST image uploads and transit data
